## üìò About the Study  

The COVID-19 pandemic triggered sharp disruptions in global economic activity and gave rise to debates over the **shape of recovery** (V-, U-, or pit-shaped). This study introduces a **new smooth transition model** and an **alternative unit root testing procedure** to evaluate whether major macroeconomic indicators follow stationary or non-stationary processes in the presence of pandemic-induced structural changes.  

Key contributions of the study include:  
- Development of a **pit-shaped smooth transition function** to capture the nonlinear adjustment between pre- and post-pandemic trends.  
- Proposal of new **unit root test statistics** derived from this transition model.  
- **Monte Carlo simulations** to evaluate size and power properties of the new test.  
- An empirical application using **monthly industrial production index (IPI)**, **consumer price index (CPI)**, and **unemployment rates** of the G8 countries (2013‚Äì2021).  

**Findings:**  
The results demonstrate that pandemic-related shocks produced distinct pit-shaped adjustments in industrial production and unemployment across G8 economies, while consumer prices showed more heterogeneous responses. The new test proves to be more powerful than conventional linear tests in detecting such nonlinear dynamics:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
